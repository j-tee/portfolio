                I am a Fullstack web developer and a graduate of Microverse with
                experience in building beautiful and responsive web
                applications.

                    My experience at Microverse has greatly improved skills in
                    both front and backend-end development. I worked on a number
                    of weekly projects that were focused on fullstack
                    development using CSS, javascript, HTML and combination of
                    frameworks such as ReactJS and Ruby On Rails. Other
                    technologies I have experience in includes Angular and
                    .NetCore MVC and WebAPI and database management systems such
                    as MSSQL, MySQL and PostgreSQL.

                    The Microverse experience is a hands-on student-centered
                    program. This approach helped me cultivate relevant skills
                    in researching and learning new concepts. As an online
                    school, learning requires remote collaboration with other
                    students across the globe on various projects. This
                    experience has improved my collaborative and remote working
                    skills,

                    My four-year bachelorâ€™s program has been mentally
                    stimulating and provided me with the academic disciplines
                    and the resilience to complete assignments on schedule and
                    according to specific requirements. Having been an active
                    footballer in the past, the experiences of defeat and
                    victory have thought me how to deal with odds and uphill
                    tasks.
